pu.sh
=====

**pu.sh** is a small footprint POSIX shell script which deploys a
nice versioned backup solution based on rsync's hardlinking
capability, which creates many snapshots in local or remote hosts
(with SSH) without data redundancy.

**Why?**

When I wrote this script back in 2008 I had to backup virtual machines
with only 64MB of RAM. *pu.sh* can be ran by light command-line
interpreters as *ash* or the Debian variant *dash*.

Install instructions
--------------------

It's simple, just copy the file ``pu.sh`` to some directory in your
``PATH`` and give it *execute* permission.

Running
-------

To run ``pu.sh`` you must have these softwares installed in your
computer:

* rsync;
* OpenSSH client (ssh), if you need push backups to a remote host.

**Synopsys**::

   $ pu.sh [-q] [-v]... [-e FILE] [-l FILE] [--] SRC [SRC]... [[USER@]HOST:]DEST

Usage examples
--------------

Backup some dirs into /var/backups::

   $ pu.sh /home /usr/local/bin /var/backups

Backup / with a exclude list into /backups on example.net::

   # pu.sh -e /etc/pu-sh/exclude.list / root@example.net:/backups/

Backup /var/mail to remote host and writes a log in /var/log/pu-sh.log::

   # pu.sh -l /var/log/pu-sh.log /var/mail root@192.168.0.1:/var/cache/pu-sh

For more instructions, run ``pu.sh -h``.

Simple deploy
-------------

Put the script below to be ran by *cron*::

   #!/bin/sh
   SOURCES="/etc /srv /opt /home /root /var/lib /var/www /usr/local /var/log /var/mail /var/spool"
   DEST="user@example.net:/backups/`hostname -f`"

   cat <<END_EXCLUDE_LIST | /usr/local/bin/pu.sh -q -l /var/log/pu-sh.log $SOURCES $DEST
   lost+found/
   *~
   .nfs*
   /media
   /mnt
   /dev
   /proc
   /sys
   /tmp
   /var/tmp
   END_EXCLUDE_LIST

On destination directory, you gonna get something like this::

   2008-02-22_21:17:02/    2008-02-23_01:17:02/    2008-02-23_05:17:02/
   2008-02-22_22:17:02/    2008-02-23_02:17:02/    2008-02-23_06:17:02/
   2008-02-23_10:17:02/    last@
